The main code for this assignment can be found in src/Shallow_water_equations_main.py. 

This code is supported by functions that can be found in

initial_conditions.py (contains functions which produce all four initial conditions considered in the report)

numerical_methods.py (contains functions which compute the numerical schemes)

plotting_functions.py (contains functions which produce the graphs for the report, as well as functions which compute the error between the analytic solution and numerical solutions)

in the src folder.

The dispersion_graph.py is a standalone python script which used to produce the figure in the report which compares the dispersion relations of the numerical schemes and the analytic solution.
