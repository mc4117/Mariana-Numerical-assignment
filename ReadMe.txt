The main code for this assignment can be found in src/Shallow_water_equations_main.py. 

This code is supported by functions that can be found in the following files located in the src folder:

error_functions.py (contains functions which compute the error between the analytic solution and the numerical solutions)

initial_conditions.py (contains functions which calculate the initial conditions considered in the report)

numerical_methods.py (contains functions which simulate the shallow water equations using four different numerical schemes)

plotting_functions.py (contains functions which produce the graphs for the report).


The dispersion_graph.py is a standalone python script which is used to produce the figure in the report which compares 
the dispersion relations of the numerical schemes to the dispersion relation of the analytic solution.
