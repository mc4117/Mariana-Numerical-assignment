You still need a .gitignore file so that you do not put png, pdf, gz, pyc files etc into your .git repository. You need to remove these files.

Comments on file error_code.py

This file uses global variables. Avoid global variables.

Plot errors versus resolution using a log-log plot (ie plt.loglog) rather than plt.plot.

Make sure that lines don't have more than 80 characters

Your command:

nt_range2[j] = (total_time)/dt

has unnecessary brackets and is subject to rounding error.

You also have unnecessary brackets in your expression:

u[y] = uOld[y] - (c*math.sqrt(g/H)/2)*(hOld[(y+1)%nx] - hOld[(y-1)%nx])

I would use:

u[y] = uOld[y] - 0.5*c*sqrt(g/H)*(hOld[(y+1)%nx] - hOld[(y-1)%nx])

And put at the top

from cmath import sqrt

In your code:
print(nt_range2)
nt_range2 = nt_range2.astype('int')    
Make the print message more useful for someone who has not read the code. 
Can you make the code stop with an error message if the values are not integers?

I have just changed this code to:
print(nt_range2)
nt_range2 = nt_range2.astype('int')    
print(nt_range2)

and I have changed:
nx_range2 = [20, 40, 50,52,60,68,70, 80, 100]

And the print statements give the following:
[  50.  100.  125.  130.  150.  170.  175.  200.  250.]
[ 49  99 124 130 150 170 174 199 249]

Found the problem I think. This would also explain the 1st-order convergence
